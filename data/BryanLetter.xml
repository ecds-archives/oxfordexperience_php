        <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
captured in color at 300dpi.  These digital images were converted to
an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear

<salute>Dear Mother, </salute>
	<p>I will snatch a 
few minutes this morning
and write you a few
lines. Yesterday I 
was fagged out and
rested in bed a good 
part of the day. Right
now is the <sic>cruci</sic> time
and I have to work 
like fury to keep from
losing out.<pb facs="1910-12-19_2.jpg"/>

I have a Bible exam Wednesday,
Chem quiz, Chem Exam Wednesday
and Calculus exam Thursday</p>
	<p>This is Tuesday now. I didn't
get time to finish this letter
yesterday but had to quit for 
a class. I was up last night
till eleven and got up at four
this morning I get where I consider
sleep a nuisance. It seems 
as if in these last days
I have more than mortal
man can do.</p>
	<p>Rev. Ta Brade announced
last Sunday that Bishop
Candler would give us
two weeks of time for the
carrying out of a revival in 
the spring. The boys will 
consider it a great blessing 
to be allowed to hear<pb facs="1910-12-19_3.jpg"/>

him.
I have finished
my book review. I
think I shall have 
it typewritten hoping
it will make a better
impression. After 
I got over my disappointment at not getting to
use my essay on 
Joseph I like the 
idea of writing a review as I have come<pb facs="1910-12-19_4.jpg"/>

to know the story 
of the book as I would 
never have known it
otherwise.</p>
	<p>Everything is beginning
to assume a Christmas 
appearance. Every night
we hear fire crackers
popping all about and
crowds of boys slip
around out of sight of
the phelgmatic marshall
Last night Prof. Bryan
had all the Hall boys<pb facs="1910-12-19_5.jpg"/>

lecturing to them and telling
them that there had been
entirely too much noise about
the place that they must
be more quiet when some
fellow slipped up and 
turned a cannon cracker
loose under his room.</p>
	<p>School will be <sic>close</sic>
Thursday night at four
and I will not go to Atlanta
till Friday morning I am 
going to see Miss Chambers
Friday night and will get
home Saturday morning
I expect I will have back
a few days early as I 
have some work that just
must be done if I make
what I have set out to do
this fall.</p><pb facs="1910-12-19_6.jpg"/>

<p>I thought I had better
go to see Miss Chambers 
this time as I failed to 
show up on Thanksgiving</p>
