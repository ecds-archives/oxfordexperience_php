        <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
captured in color at 300dpi.  These digital images were converted to
an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
in the original text.</p>

<salute>Dear Mother, </salute>
	<p>I will snatch a 
<lb/>few minutes this morning
<lb/>and write you a few
<lb/>lines. Yesterday I 
<lb/>was fogged out and
<lb/>rested in bed a good 
<lb/>part of the day. Right
<lb/>now is the cruci[al] time
<lb/>and I have to work 
<lb/>like fury to keep from
<lb/>losing out.<pb n="[1]"/>

I have a Bible exam Wednesday,
<lb/>Chem quiz, Chem Exam Wednesday
<lb/>and Calculus exam Thursday</p>
	<p>This is Tuesday now. I didn't
<lb/>get time to finish this letter
<lb/>yesterday but had to quit for 
<lb/>a class. I was up last night
<lb/>till eleven and got up at four
<lb/>this morning I get where I consider
<lb/>sleep a nu[i]sance. It seems 
<lb/>as if in these last days
<lb/>I have more than mortal
<lb/>man can do.</p>
	<p>Rev. Ta Brade announced
<lb/>last Sunday that Bishop
<lb/>Candler would give us
<lb/>two weeks of time for the
<lb/>carrying out of a rivival in 
<lb/>the spring. The boys will 
<lb/>consider it a great blessing 
<lb/>to be allowed to hear<pb n="[2]"/>

him.
<lb/>I have finished
<lb/>my book review. I
<lb/>think I shall have 
<lb/>it typewritten hoping
<lb/>it will make a better
<lb/>impression. After 
<lb/>I got over my dissapoint
<lb/>ment at not getting to
<lb/>use my essay on 
<lb/>Joseph I like the 
<lb/>idea of writing a review as I have come<pb n="[3]"/>

to know the story 
<lb/>of the book as I would 
<lb/>never have known it
<lb/>otherwise.</p>
	<p>Everything is beginning
<lb/>to assume a Christmas 
<lb/>appearance. Every night
<lb/>we hear fire crackers
<lb/>popping all about and
<lb/>crowds of boys slip
<lb/>around out of sight of
<lb/>the phelgmatic marshall
<lb/>Last night Prof. Bryan
<lb/>has all the Hall boys<pb n="[4]"/>

lecturing to them and telling
<lb/>them that there had been
<lb/>entirely too much noise about
<lb/>the place that they must
<lb/>be more quiet when some
<lb/>felon slipped up and 
<lb/>turned a cannon cracker
<lb/>loose under his room.</p>
	<p>School will be close[d]
<lb/>Thursday night at four
<lb/>and I will not go to atlanta
<lb/>till Friday morning I am 
<lb/>going to see Miss Chambers
<lb/>Friday night and will get
<lb/>home Saturday morning
<lb/>I expect I will have clock
<lb/>a few days early as I 
<lb/>have some work that just
<lb/>must be done if I make
<lb/>what I have set out to do
<lb/>this fall.</p><pb n="[5]"/>

<p>I thought I had better
<lb/>go to see Miss Chambers 
<lb/>this time as I failed to 
<lb/>show up on Thanksgiving</p>
