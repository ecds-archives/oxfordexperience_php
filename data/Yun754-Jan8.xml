        <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
captured in color at 300dpi.  These digital images were converted to
an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
in the original text.</p>

<p>Cold &#x0026; bright</p>
<p>Wrote to Dear <name type="person"><choice><reg>Abbie Hoss</reg><sic>Mrs. H.</sic></choice> </name>: --
"I never thought it likely that <name type="place"><choice><reg>Oxford, Georgia</reg><sic>Oxford</sic></choice></name> would get very cold.  But I was mistaken.  For the several days past, water freezes in my room most nights &#x0026; sometimes in day time.  Am enjoying cold weather, however.</p>

<p>"Nothing unusual to disturb the <choice><corr>monotony</corr><sic>monotoy</sic></choice> of the college routine.  A <name type="place"><choice><reg>South Carolina</reg><sic>S.C.</sic></choice></name> boy, named <name>Wilson</name>, had to go home or rather had to be taken home on account of lunatic fits.  This state of mind was brought on by excessive use of <choice><corr>cigarettes</corr><sic>cigaretts</sic></choice>.  When he got into a fit -- &#x0026; that he did many times an hour -- he poured out 'cusses' in an unbroken stream.  One evening <name type="person"><choice><reg>Warren Candler</reg><sic>Dr. Candler</sic></choice></name> called on him.  Hearing the <name type="person"><choice><reg>Warren Candler</reg><sic>Dr. Wilson</sic></choice></name> cried out "Oh! Look at that <hi rend="underline">bob-tailed monkey</hi>!  Take him out! Quick!"  Then followed a long string of 'cusses' of the queerest &#x0026; worst kinds.

Am waiting for an answer from <name type="person"><choice><reg>Young John Allen</reg><sic>Dr. Allen</sic></choice></name> in regard to my [?] movement.  In case of his telling me come back to <name type="place">Shanghai</name> -- which is most likely -- I shall have to go to <name type="place"><choice><reg>Nashville, Tennessee"</reg><sic>Nash.</sic></choice></name> on my way to <name type="place"><choice><reg>San Francisco, California</reg><sic>San F'co</sic></choice></name>,</p>
