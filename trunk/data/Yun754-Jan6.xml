        <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
captured in color at 300dpi.  These digital images were converted to
an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
in the original text.</p>

<p>Very cold this morning.</p>
<p>In the Soph. Bib. Class <name type="person">Dr. C<reg>Candler, W. A. (William Akin)</reg></name> in commenting on the courage and virtues of <name type="person">Esther</name> gave some firm &#x0026; forceful remarks.  In substance he said: --
<list type="ordered"><item>1. Riches &#x0026; beauty are two things that are very rarely consecrated to God.</item>
<item>2. Woman's suffrage means every body's suffering.  Her business is to be the queen of the home.  You ask "Isn't <name type="person">Francis <pb facs="Yun754-Jan6-2Jan8-1.jpg"/>Willard</name> a good woman?"  Yes: very good; but politics are none of her business.  Isn't she smart? Yes: very smart; very she wasn't made for voting.  I would rather see her in heaven than at the ballot box.  (And I shall see her in heaven long before she can vote.)</item></list></p>
