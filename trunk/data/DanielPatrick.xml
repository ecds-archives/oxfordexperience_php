        <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
captured in color at 300dpi.  These digital images were converted to
an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
in the original text.</p>

	<p>On last Thursday <date value ="1897-04">April</date> and Friday
  nights whilst I was in Atlanta there
was serious disorder here. Bonfires
were kindled on the campus, bombs
belonging to the contractor on the new 
building were burned; pistols were
fired; <name type="person" reg="Dr. Moore ">Dr. Moore's </name>  fencing was

<p>  One of the causes 
which prevented my recessing in
Atlanta over Sunday as I greatly
desired *^ too*  (NEED TAG HERE) was a telephone message
advising my return here on the 
account of this disorder.</p>

pleading for Christian education 
buys whom I implicitly trusted
can bring dishonor to the institution I 
feel like laying down the work 
as a vain and impossible task.  
Yet I am conscious of leaving the book.  
I know how to make Christian men 
and I must learn my familiar in God's hands.</p>
