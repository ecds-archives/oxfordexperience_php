        <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
captured in color at 300dpi.  These digital images were converted to
an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
in the original text.</p>

<opener><salute>Dear Townie</salute></opener>
	
	<p>You are soon to leave the friends and companions of your collegiate course, soon to mingle in the bustle of active life with those whose hearts may have no pulsation in unison with your own. Trust in God and do your duty and all will be well.</p>
	<p>May you be as happy as your kindness and gentleness entitles you to be. I could wish you no richer blessing.</p>
	<p>In turning these pages, if your eye may chance to fall upon my name, think "of me as I am nothing extenuate." I know you will not "set down anger in malice."</p>
	<p>Be assured that I shall always cherish the memory of our echo throughout our whole aquaintances has created new with so much kindness and consideration. Always be what you are now and I think I can promise you happiness.</p>
	<p>"But if our life's uncertain main, mishaps shall mar thy sail, if faithful fierce and true in vain, was want and exile thou sustain. <pb facs="6044.jpg-"/>Beneath thou fickle gale; waste not a sigh on fortunes changed."</p>
	<p>I hope that the blinded lights of science and Religion may beam upon the dark path of life,and irradiate the gloom of the very sepulcher for you my friend. After our seperation meet me in heaven.</p>
