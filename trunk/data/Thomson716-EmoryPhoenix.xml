        <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
captured in color at 300dpi.  These digital images were converted to
an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
in the original text.</p>

<head rend="center">EXPENSES.</head>
<p>The total cost of a year at Emory is as low as that of any first class college on this continent-lower than most.  It has not seemed wise to the authorities of the institution to weaken its teaching force in order to make tuition free to all, but rather to grant such help to those only who really need it.</p>
<p>But while it advertises no "free tuition," board (a much larger item than tuition in a college course) is so low in Oxford, and the expenses arising from the social surroundings of the College (which cannot be stated in a catalogue, but are often heavily felt by the student) are so small, the annual expenses of a student at Emory College, exclusive of clothing, can be brought within $200.  The following schedule gives the rate of board, tuition, books, etc:</p>
<hi rend="center">Matriculation Fee............................ $5.00

<head rend="center">BOARD, Etc.</head>
<p>Board-including fuel, lights, etc.-can be obtained in good families at from $12.00 to $16.50 per month. Fifty dollars, paid in advance, will secure the highest priced board, including fuel, servants' attention, etc. for three months.  Washing costs from $1.00 to $1.50 per month.  Board in "Helping Hall" $8.00 to $10.00 per month.</p>
<head rend="center">Cost of Books, Etc.</head>
<p>First-class Latin and Greek Lexicons cost from $2.00 to $3.00 each.  These will answer during the entire college course.  Text-books will cost, on an average, about $10.00 per annum.  Very often second-hand books can be purchased at <hi rend="smallcaps">half rates</hi>.</p>
<p>A full supply of Text-books used in the Institution is kept onsale at the College at publishers' prices.  For further information, write to the President,</p>
