      <editorialDecl>
        <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
captured in color at 300dpi.  These digital images were converted to
an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
in the original text.</p>

<p>I wrote nothing last night as I called upon a lady and didn't return in time. I enjoyed myself very much with 
Miss Sallie <unclear reason="illegible">Hall</unclear>
and could hardly leave when the time 
<choice><sic> come</sic><reg>came</reg></choice>.</p>


<p>To day I have been reading something of 
<choice>
<reg>Napoleon Bonaparte I <sic>Nepolean's</sic>
  banishment to <sic> St.Heellina</sic>St. Helena by
Scott.
It seemed that his banishment was just - though it's thought otherwise by most of men. 
If what Scott says be true he was justly banished for if he had not been 
it's more than probable that he would have again caused a war between 
<name type="place"> England </name> &#x0026;
<name type="place"> France </name>
and thus the justice.</p>
